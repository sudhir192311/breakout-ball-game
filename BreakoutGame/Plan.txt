Plan
======================

Description:
For my game I plan to make a classic Breakout version with the additional feature
of a two person mode. Users will be able to select which game mode to play. More 
details on the planned game are below. 

Single Player Mode
__________________________________

Block Configuration / Levels:
	In single player mode the blocks will be generated to correspond with the level
	the players is currently on. For example, when a player is on level N the level 
	will start with N rows. The blocks in each row will all have n "lives" where n is 
	the row the block is part of. An example of this configuration for levels one 
	through three is shown below. The blocks will in total give a number of points 
	that is a function of how many times said block had to be hit to break. The
	different block colors will correspond with the different block types.


Level 1:
 ________
|11111111|
|        |
|        |
|   .    |
| _      |
|________|

Level 2:
 ________
|22222222|
|11111111|
|    	 |
|   .    |
|    _   |
|________|


Level 3:
 ________
|33333333|
|22222222|
|11111111|
|   .    |
|   _    |
|________|

Paddle:
	The paddle will be at the bottom of the screen and moved in the x direction using buttons on the keyboard.

Power Ups / Paddle abilities
	Every time a block loses a life it will have a chance of 
	dropping each power up. If the users collects the falling
	power up with his or her paddle they will be rewarded the
	respective power up. Power ups will expire after a period 
	of time or will be replaced if another power up is picked
	up.Some of the power ups I intend to incorporate are listed
	below.
	
	Power ups:
			- + 1 life
			- - 1 life
			- smaller paddle
			- bigger paddle
			- strong ball (will break any block regardless of that block's amount of lives)
			- weak ball (ball will not damage any blocks)
			- faster ball
			- slower ball
			- score multiplier 
	
Lives:
	The player will start with a certain number of lives and every time the ball goes under
	the paddle, a life will be lost. On the lost of all of lives, the player's game will be
	over.
	
Score display:
	The players score will be displayed on the top of the screen. The score will be a function
	of the amount of blocks the player has destroyed. 
	
Cheat Keys;
	The following are a list of cheat keys I plan to incorporate.
	Keys:
		P: will pause the ball
		Mouse Click: will remove a block if said block is clicked
		Number key: will jump to that level
		L: Will give the player an additional life
		R: resets the game to the starting configuration
	
Splash Screen:
	The splash screen will show descriptions of single and multiplayer modes and allow users
	to select which game mode they want to play.
	
Extra Game Feature / Multiplayer Mode:

Description:
	 Multiplayer mode will be a combination of pong and breakout. There will be two paddles one
	 towards the top of the screen and one toward the bottom. The second padldle will be controlled
	 with different keyboard buttons. The game will start with each paddle having its own ball. If a 
	 ball makes it past a players paddle they will lose a life and lose points. The game will continue
	 though and the ball will be replaced on the map. When one playerloses all of his or her lives the
	 game is over and the player with more points is the winner. A diagram of a possible setup is shown 
	 below.
	 
  Multiplayer Level 2:
     ________ 
	|  _     |
	|   .    | 
	|11111111|
	|22222222|
	|11111111|
	|   .    |
	|   _    |
	|________|
	
	The score for both players will be displayed at the top of the screen. In multiplayer mode
	power ups have an equal chance of falling up or down, but will work in generally the same 
	way as they do in single player.
